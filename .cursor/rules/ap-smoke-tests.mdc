# AP Smoke Tests

After any change to KSP or KAPT logic, always build **and run** both test projects before considering the work done:

```bash
cd tests/projects/ksp-sample && ../../../target/debug/kargo run
cd tests/projects/kapt-sample && ../../../target/debug/kargo run
```

Build the kargo binary first with `cargo build` if needed.

Both must complete with exit code 0 and produce expected output. If either fails, investigate and fix before proceeding.
